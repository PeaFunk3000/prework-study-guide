# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was a project undertaken to prepare for a 16 week intensive Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development.

The motivation was to become familiar with brand new languages and tools that will be explored in depth during the Bootcamp. This will enable me to 'hit the ground running' when the course commences.

The problem solved by this project was the absence of any knowledge in topic areas such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

Initial language skills were developed in HTML, CSS, JS and Git, as well as application and appreciation of the GitFlow for Git version control, using GitHub to manage the project.

Topics covered are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 

If the DevTools console is opened, you can see the implemented JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned from the prework study and choose one topic at random for us to study first.
