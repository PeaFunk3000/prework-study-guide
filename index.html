        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Meta and Title elements are examples that are nested inside the head element</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage </li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic. It is still common to see non-semantic elements, but best practice is to use semantic elements where possible.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. Elements that hold the children are parent elements.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or a block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains imformation about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (anchor) creates links to webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Combining two selectors, eg. h1,h2, into a single CSS rule with a comma, allows the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
            <li>This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
            <li>In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline boxes.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>It's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code using git pull origin main</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Git Flow</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add, commit, and push our work to current feature (branch)</li>
          <li>Open pull request to merge changes with the main branch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cheat Sheet</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git pull: fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content </li>
          <li>git log: shows all commits in the current branch's history</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m: commits changes made, -m flag to associate a message with the commit</li>
          <li>git log: shows the commit history for the currently active branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.</li>
          <li>Conditional logic and arrays—can be applied to many other in-demand OOP languages.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the body element.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript. When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name.</li>
          <li>Just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically. To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
